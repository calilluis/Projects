In this project i've tried to apply what we have learnt on class on the previous 2 projects.
I have done the following:
I've searched on the internet different models to put (i didn't want to use a simple square). So I first found a pinguin model (its in the project) but i finally decided to use a "donut" one. I prefered it haha. I created prefabs of both. 
Then I also substituted the squares of the wrists by a hand model, that is more visual and more cool.
Searching and substituting the models carried me some problems but the final result was cool.
Finally i decided to put 3 levels of interaction:
	- On the first touch of a hand touching a donut, it changes the  colour of the base to 'blue'
	- On second touch, the donut begins rotating.
	- Finally, on the third touch, the donut disapears.
