#Torre d'en Galmes Game
This is a game thought for being implemented in the culture visit of Torre d'en Galmes, in Menorca. It's thought for the childs to play while they learn.

This app needs to be used with external hardware in order to work correctly. Speciffically, it needs some RFID antennas and a Keonn AdvanReader.
Anyway, it's good to see some Android code with the integration of an XML parser, as well as the integration of an Android App with RFID technology.
