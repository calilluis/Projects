In this project I've tried to improve the project 1.
Added things:
-Change in design, now is more a NEON game.
-Sound effect when the game starts.
-Added walls with animation to increase difficulty.
-Added 2 screen visualitzation with 2 cameras (A setup to render the image in a panoramic display (two continuous screens) ).
-Added a mini map camera that shows the game from the top view included in a render texture in an object in the scene.
Hope you like it,
