I've finished what we didn't finish in class. There is an error in the statement (there is no evidence of the initalitzation of the variable sheepList.)
I've changed some parameters in order to have a better human-computer interaction (changed the time the sheep stays before desapearing, the time between shots, etc.). I've also added another Windmill.

I've also read the part 2 of the exercise and i decided to implement the Visuals Part. Now my game shows a rotating Heart when the Hay hits the sheep, 
and the visuals of the sheep and the heart desapearing are also optimized visually.

Finally, I've also done the Keeping Score part, but I don't know why the game does not finish after the 3 sheeps cross the hay machine. The tutorial says they hit an invisible trigger, 
but i've searched and in the hole tutorial there is no explanation of creating a
trigger for the sheep. I suppose is maybe already there, and maybe is an error of me following the tutorial.
